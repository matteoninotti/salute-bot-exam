"""The watcher daemon — the long-running Service (D21) that scrapes and alerts.

Single-instance guard (D27): the daemon takes an **exclusive, non-blocking
`flock`** on a lockfile at startup and refuses to start if the lock is already
held. This is a *kernel-owned* lock tied to the open file description, so it
**auto-releases on any exit — crash included** — with no stale-PID-file problem.
It composes with systemd (`Restart=always`, one instance, D21): even a stray
manual launch alongside the managed service cannot spawn a second competing
scraper, which is what keeps single-flight structural (D27).

The loop itself is self-clocking (D21/D22), serves check-now requests first
(D39), resolves pending registrations (D40), then sweeps due prestazioni.
