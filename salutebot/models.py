"""Core domain types.

The `Slot` is the unit the watcher diffs cycle-to-cycle. Its identity is a
*natural key* built from business fields (D16), because the CUP engine exposes
no stable backend slot id — row ids are positional ICEfaces dataTable indices
re-numbered on every render. The key is deliberately narrow (date, time,
struttura, CAP); doctor/unit and the full address are descriptive only, kept
out of the key because they are the most cosmetically volatile fields and would
cause false "new slot" alerts.
