"""Offline tests for the live Playwright drive (Phase 4).

The flow itself can only be verified by the live smoke run (`python -m
salutebot.scraper.drive`, needs a real ricetta + network) — these cover the parts
that need no browser: the selector helper, `from_env`, and the error contract (any
failure surfaces as a transient `ScrapeError`, D11). The form-page selectors are
verified separately against the live DOM, not here.
